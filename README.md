## Linear Algebra

This is a C++20 library written when I study Linear Algebra. The library is used to practice My C++ and give me some feedback to learning Linear algebra.

It could be built from: [linear_algebra_test_build](https://github.com/water-chika/linear_algebra_test_build)

Recently I use a standalone building repo to seperate building from source code because this could resolve duplicate deps of repos.

## SPIRV Parser

It contains a SPIRV disassember: [spirv_parser](https://github.com/water-chika/spirv_parser)
